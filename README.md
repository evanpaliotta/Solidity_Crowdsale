# Solidity Crowdsale

Smart contracts written in Solidity and designed to raise funds for a partifular project.  Used OpenZeppelin to create a standard ERC20 token minted through a Crowdsale contract.  Once deployed on a testnet, the contract allows users to send ETH and receive ShareCoin along with minting the tokens to distribute to buyers.
